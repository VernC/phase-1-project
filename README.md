[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A well-written informative README.md file. This is the business card of your project and you really want it to look great! A template can be found here: makeareadme.com (Links to an external site.). If you used someone else's pictures or material please make sure you give them credits in your README. If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add value, add them to your README.md. If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without leaving the README's page on GitHub!

I'm creating an API finder. I struggled finding a good api for my project so I thought. What's better then a project that helps other people find the api that they need.
